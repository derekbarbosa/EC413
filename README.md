In EC413, we learn about computer organization and basic computer architecture.
The course begins with a general overview of computer systems, memory hierarchy, cache r/w + miss/hits, as well as virtual memory. 

The concept of adders and other digital logic unit "setpieces" are also revisted in preparation for understanding the major components of the 32-bit MIPS AL CPU. Labs build upon each other, eventually leading up to the creation of ones "own" MIPS CPU in Verilog.

Labs 2 - 7 (all verilog labs) are included in this repo.

Please enjoy, and contact me with any questions!
